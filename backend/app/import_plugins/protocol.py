"""Contract for import format handlers.

Every format that Topos can import (``.bgb``, single Markdown,
write-book-template ZIP, git URL, ...) implements :class:`ImportPlugin`.

Two-phase design: :meth:`ImportPlugin.detect` is read-only, returns a
:class:`DetectedProject` for the wizard's preview panel. The user
reviews/overrides, then :meth:`ImportPlugin.execute` commits the
import in a second call.

See ``docs/explorations/core-import-orchestrator.md`` for the full
architecture.
