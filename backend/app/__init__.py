"""MyApp backend app package.

The running app's version is derived at import time from
``backend/pyproject.toml``, the canonical Python source-of-truth.
Routers and the OpenAPI metadata read ``__version__`` rather than
hardcoding the number; ``pyproject.toml`` is the only file that
needs to be edited at release time.

The backend is intentionally ``package-mode = false`` (Poetry does
not publish it as a distribution), so ``importlib.metadata`` is
not available for it - hence the tomllib parse below.
