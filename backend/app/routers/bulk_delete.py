"""Bulk delete for Articles, Books, and ArticleComments.

Three endpoints, mirrored:

    POST /api/articles/bulk-delete
    POST /api/books/bulk-delete
    POST /api/comments/bulk-delete

Body shape (all endpoints):

    {"ids": ["...", "..."], "permanent": false}

Response shape:

    {"deleted_count": int,
     "skipped_already_trashed": ["..."],
     "failed": [{"id": "...", "error": "..."}]}

Soft path (``permanent=false``, default): sets ``deleted_at`` on
every row whose ``deleted_at IS NULL``. Already-trashed rows land
in ``skipped_already_trashed`` (idempotent; never raises).

Permanent path (``permanent=true``): hard-deletes the row.
SQLAlchemy ``cascade="all, delete-orphan"`` handles the children
(Article -> Publication / ArticleAsset / ArticleImportSource;
Book -> Chapter / Asset / BookImportSource), all verified in
models/__init__.py. ArticleComment is a leaf in the data model
(no cascade children), so the permanent path just removes the
row.

No hard cap. Bulk-delete is intentionally uncapped (unlike bulk-
export which keeps its 200-article cap): the cost profile is
"DB UPDATE / DELETE per row" rather than "spawn pandoc per row +
network round-trip per asset", so 1000-row deletes complete in
under a second and don't trip request-timeout limits. See the
"Bulk-operation limits should be per-operation cost-profile"
lessons-learned entry for the rule.

The endpoint never short-circuits on a single failing row: per-row
errors land in ``failed[]`` with the offending ID so the caller's
toast can render "X deleted, Y already trashed, Z failed".
