"""Comments admin endpoints.

MEDIUM-COMMENTS-IMPORT-01 commit 7 originally shipped a v1 admin
surface with soft-delete only; the trash-lifecycle counterparts
(list-trashed, restore, permanent-delete-from-trash) were
documented as "deferred to v2". Bug 10 (2026-05-16) shipped
those endpoints — comments now follow the same trash-lifecycle
shape as Articles and Books.

Lives in core (not in the medium-import plugin) so future
importers (WordPress, Hashnode, etc.) write to the same
``article_comments`` table and the admin surface stays
provider-agnostic.

Endpoints:

  GET    /api/comments                 list comments, filterable
                                       by imported_from +
                                       orphans_only. Soft-deleted
                                       rows are excluded.
  DELETE /api/comments/{id}            soft-delete a single
                                       comment. Idempotent.
  GET    /api/comments/trash/list      list every comment
                                       currently in the trash,
                                       newest-trashed first.
  POST   /api/comments/trash/{id}/restore
                                       restore a trashed comment.
                                       404 when id is unknown OR
                                       not currently in the trash.
  DELETE /api/comments/trash/empty     permanently delete every
                                       comment in the trash.
  DELETE /api/comments/trash/{id}      permanently delete one
                                       comment from the trash.
                                       404 when not in the trash.
  POST   /api/comments/{id}/reclassify-as-article
                                       move comment → article.
                                       Soft-deleted comments are
                                       eligible (the user can
                                       notice a misclassification
                                       post-trash).
