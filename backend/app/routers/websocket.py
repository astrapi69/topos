"""Generic WebSocket hub for real-time event broadcasting.

Not audiobook-specific. Supports topic-based subscriptions so
multiple features can share the same infrastructure:

- ``audiobook:{book_id}`` for audiobook export events
- ``book:{book_id}`` for general book update events (reserved)
- ``plugin:{name}:events`` for plugin events (reserved)

Clients connect to ``/api/ws/{topic}`` and receive JSON messages.
The connection is server-push only for now; client messages are
read (to keep the connection alive) but not processed.

Usage from backend code::

    from app.routers.websocket import manager

    await manager.broadcast("audiobook:abc123", {
        "event": "chapter_persisted",
        "chapter": {"title": "Vorwort", "duration_seconds": 42},
    })
