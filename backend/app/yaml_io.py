"""Round-trip YAML helpers.

PyYAML's ``dump`` silently strips comments, blank lines, and quote styles.
For user-facing config files (plugin settings, app.yaml) that may contain
``# INTERNAL`` markers per the architecture rules, we use ruamel.yaml in
round-trip mode so comments and formatting survive a save through the UI.
