    Priority (highest wins):

       set, it is IMPOSSIBLE to reach the production DB from this
       function, which is the whole point (see tests/conftest.py and
       tests/test_test_isolation.py).
    2. DATABASE_URL env var is honoured verbatim.
    3. MYAPP_DATA_DIR derivation: when set, the database path is
       derived as ``<MYAPP_DATA_DIR>/myapp.db``.
    4. Default falls through to ``app.paths.get_db_path()`` which
       uses platformdirs for the canonical OS-specific data directory.

    DEP-DBPATH-01 step 3 (full removal): the legacy
    ``MYAPP_DB_PATH`` env var is no longer honoured as a path
    override. If it is still set in the environment, the resolver
    emits a single warning naming the ignored value so the user can
    see it has no effect, then resolves the path through the normal
    DATA_DIR / platformdirs chain. Step 1 (deprecation warning)
    shipped in v0.27.0; step 2 (precedence flip) shipped in v0.28.0;
    this is the final removal.
