"""One-time migration of project-tree data to the XDG data dir.

Phase 2 of the test-isolation hardening (see ``app.paths``)
moved the canonical data directory from the project tree
(``backend/`` next to the source code) to a platformdirs
location (``~/.local/share/myapp`` on Linux/macOS,
``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\myapp`` on Windows).

This module ports a v0.25.0 user's existing data into the new
location on first start after the upgrade. It runs before
``init_db()`` so a moved SQLite DB is picked up rather than
recreated empty.

Design rules:

- **Idempotent.** A ``.migration-complete`` marker in the target
  dir short-circuits subsequent runs.
- **Fail loud on conflict.** If both legacy and target paths
  contain data, raise ``RuntimeError`` so the user notices.
  Silent merge would corrupt data.
- **Breadcrumb at old path.** A ``.migrated-YYYY-MM-DD`` file is
  written next to each moved item so users can verify before
  deleting.
- **Skipped in test mode** (``MYAPP_TEST=1``). Tests get a
  fresh tmp data dir; migrating a non-existent legacy tree
  would be wasted work and would also write breadcrumbs into
  the project tree, polluting ``git status``.

Module path is ``app.data_dir_migration`` (NOT
``app.migrations``) to avoid collision with Alembic's
``backend/migrations/`` directory.
