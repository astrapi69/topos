"""In-memory async job store with progress event streaming.

Long-running exports (Audiobook above all) need per-step progress, not
just a binary pending->completed flip. Each ``Job`` carries:

- ``events`` - an append-only log so a late subscriber can replay
- ``progress`` - a small dict updated as known events arrive
  (``current_chapter``, ``total_chapters``, ``last_event``)
- one ``asyncio.Event`` per active subscriber so the SSE generator
  wakes up exactly when there is new data

Clients reach the events through:

1. ``job_store.subscribe(job_id)`` async generator (used by the SSE
   endpoint), which yields every event in order and exits cleanly when
   the synthetic ``stream_end`` event is published by ``update()``.
2. ``GET /api/export/jobs/{id}`` for polling-based fallbacks; the
   response includes the ``progress`` dict and recent events.
