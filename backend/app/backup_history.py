"""Backup history store: logs every backup and restore with metadata.

Path resolution: the default ``path`` is ``None`` and resolved
lazily via ``app.paths.get_data_dir()`` at instance construction.
The previous default (``"config/backup_history.json"``,
CWD-relative) was a path-isolation violation per
``.claude/rules/lessons-learned.md`` ("Filesystem isolation:
production data lives outside the project tree") and crashed
with ``PermissionError`` for any deployment whose CWD pointed
at a read-only project tree — the standard Docker setup is one
such deployment. Tests may still pass an explicit path.

Cross-instance consistency: three modules each instantiate their
own ``BackupHistory()`` at import time
(``routers/backup.py``, ``services/backup/backup_export.py``,
``services/backup/backup_import.py``). Without disk-rehydration
on every read+write, instances diverge — the GET endpoint reads
its router's stale in-memory list and never sees writes the
export service made through its own instance, OR a second worker
writes an entry that clobbers a first worker's entry because its
in-memory ``_entries`` was loaded at module import. ``list()``
and ``add()`` therefore both call ``_load()`` first so the
JSON file is the single source of truth and all instances/workers
converge through it. Cost: one read per call (small file, max 100
entries). The file is not large enough to warrant locking;
file-level OS locks would be a separate hardening pass (filed as
follow-up if a hot-loop add() collision is ever observed).
