"""Prompts for the Book AI-template fill workflow.

UNIVERSAL-AI-TEMPLATE-01 Session 1, commit 3/10. One builder
per Book field-class. Same ``(system_prompt, user_prompt)``
shape as ``article_template_prompts.py``; see that module's
docstring for the rationale.

Book field-classes per S5:

- ``marketing_copy``: backpage_description + backpage_author_bio
  + html_description
- ``tags``: keywords (book's tags column is named keywords)
- ``description_genre``: description + genre
- ``cover_prompt``: cover_image_prompt
- ``chapter_summaries``: one summary per chapter, matched by
  chapter_id

Books and Articles share only ``tags`` and an image-prompt
field-class structurally; the rest diverge because Book's
fillable surface (marketing copy, chapter summaries) has no
Article equivalent.

4. If you cannot generate a field with high confidence,
   return it as null. Do not invent.
