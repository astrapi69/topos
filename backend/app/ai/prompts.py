   - Explain why it matters
   - Suggest how to fix it
4. **Overall**: One sentence overall assessment.

Be constructive and specific. Refer to actual passages in the text. Avoid generic advice like "show don't tell" without pointing to a specific instance. Do not rewrite the chapter - give editorial feedback the author can act on."""
