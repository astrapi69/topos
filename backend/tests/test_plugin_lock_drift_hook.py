"""Self-check tests for the plugin-lock-paired pre-commit hook.

Sub-task 3 of PLUGIN-LOCKFILE-DRIFT-01. Tests the script directly
(option 3a in the pre-inspection): cheap, no Poetry invocation, runs
in milliseconds. The expensive-but-thorough drift detection — running
`poetry install --dry-run` per plugin — stays as the existing CI gate
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml` plugin matrix) and the optional manual
`make verify-plugin-locks` target.

The shape under test:

- ``scripts/check_plugin_lock_paired.py`` is invoked by pre-commit
  with each staged ``plugins/topos-plugin-<name>/pyproject.toml``
  path as a positional argument.
- The script consults ``git diff --cached --name-only`` to enumerate
  the staged set and asserts each hook-supplied pyproject path's
  sibling ``poetry.lock`` is also in that set.

These tests stage real plugin files in a controlled way using
``git update-index`` against a tmp work-tree clone, run the hook,
and assert exit code + key strings in stderr. The tests do NOT
mutate the actual repo's git index; they operate inside an
isolated git worktree per test (see the ``isolated_git`` fixture).
