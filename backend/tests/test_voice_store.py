"""Tests for ``voice_store.get_voices`` filter logic.

Regression: the audiobook voice dropdown leaked Edge TTS German voices
into engines like Google TTS / pyttsx3 / ElevenLabs because the frontend
fell back to a hardcoded list when ``/api/voices`` returned ``[]``. The
fix lives in the frontend, but ``get_voices`` is the contract those
fallbacks were papering over: it must filter strictly by engine, and
its language matching must be predictable in both forms (``"de"`` vs
``"de-DE"``).
