"""Structural consistency tests for the i18n YAMLs.

The goal is NOT full translation-completeness - that is tracked as a
roadmap item (I-03) - but to catch *structural* drift like the one
discovered in the v0.11 -> v0.12 audit:

1. A new subsection gets inserted at the wrong indent level, silently
   moving ~50 keys from ``ui.settings`` into ``ui.translation`` so the
   frontend ``t("ui.settings.foo")`` lookups fall back to the hardcoded
   English default instead of the localised string.
2. A bare ``on:`` / ``off:`` key in YAML gets parsed as a Python
   boolean because PyYAML follows YAML 1.1, silently dropping the key.

The tests here keep EN as the reference and verify, for every language,
that the same top-level ``ui.*`` sections exist and that no section has
non-string keys. They do not require that every leaf key is translated
(that's I-03) - only that the skeleton matches.
