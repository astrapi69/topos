"""Test harness bootstrap.

CRITICAL: this module sets MYAPP_TEST=1, TEST_DATABASE_URL and
MYAPP_DATA_DIR BEFORE any ``app.*`` import. Order matters:

- ``app/database.py`` reads ``MYAPP_TEST`` / ``TEST_DATABASE_URL``
  at module import time to decide which URL to hand to SQLAlchemy.
  Without this, a test module importing ``app.database`` before the
  conftest could wire up the production DB; the autouse ``setup_db``
  fixture below would then drop its tables.
- ``app/paths.py`` reads ``MYAPP_DATA_DIR`` lazily via
  ``get_data_dir()``, but seeding it here means every test sees
  the same tmp path even if they never call the helper directly.

A real data-loss incident in April 2026 (commit ``a4cf7cf``) triggered
the addition of the session-scoped DB tripwire. The filesystem half of
the same hardening landed in this session; the marker file written by
``app.paths.mark_data_dir_as_production`` lets the tripwire fail loud
if a test ever points ``MYAPP_DATA_DIR`` at a path that contains
real data.
