"""MAINT-01: regression test that pins every ``Book.Mapped`` column
to either the initial schema migration or a subsequent
``op.add_column`` migration.

Background. v0.22.0 shipped with ``Book.tts_speed`` declared as a
SQLAlchemy mapped column but no Alembic migration. Fresh installs
got the column via ``Base.metadata.create_all`` and worked; long-
lived dev DBs that follow the alembic-upgrade path were left
without it. The first DB query that touched ``books`` (the
trash-cleanup SELECT during lifespan, ``/api/import/detect``'s
``_check_duplicate``, ...) crashed with
``no such column: books.tts_speed`` and a 500 cascade. v0.22.1
backfilled the migration in ``c6d7e8f9a0b1_add_tts_speed_to_books.py``.

This test scans the migrations directory and the Book model to
catch any new ``Mapped`` column that lands without a paired
migration BEFORE the next release ships. Failure mode is a clear
"column X is in the model but no migration adds it; add an Alembic
revision under backend/migrations/versions/" message - much
friendlier than the runtime crash users hit.

Scope: only ``Book`` for now (the table that has historically
collected drift). Other tables can join the audit if drift surfaces
elsewhere.
