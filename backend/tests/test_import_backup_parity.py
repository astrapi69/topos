"""Parity probe: same .bgb through legacy /api/backup/import vs orchestrator.

CIO-05 removed ``/api/backup/smart-import`` + ``/api/backup/import-project``
but kept ``/api/backup/import`` (scoped to .bgb). The orchestrator's
``BgbImportHandler`` reuses ``backup_import._restore_book_from_dir``
underneath, so the two paths SHOULD produce an identical book. This
test pins that invariant so a future refactor of one path cannot
silently drift from the other.
