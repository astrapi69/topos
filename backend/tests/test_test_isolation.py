"""Regression tests for the test-vs-production DB isolation contract.

These tests exist as a tripwire: if somebody reverts the env-var logic
in app/database.py or reorders imports in tests/conftest.py, at least
one of these asserts fails loudly. The April 2026 data-loss incident
(test suite dropped the user's production topos.db) is the reason
this file exists.
