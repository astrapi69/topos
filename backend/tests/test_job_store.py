    Cleanup happens in the async generator's ``finally`` clause when
    ``aclosing()`` runs. Mutmut wraps every async generator in an
    outer trampoline generator that iterates the mutated original;
    when ``aclose()`` runs on the outer, the inner's ``finally`` is
    scheduled through the event loop but may not have completed when
    the immediately-following assertion fires. Poll with a small
    timeout so the test stays meaningful under mutmut's trampoline
    overhead and is robust to scheduler noise without losing what it
    actually verifies (the subscriber list returns to empty).
