"""Bilingual parity for docs/help/en/ and docs/help/de/.

Every English help page must have a German counterpart at the
same path, and vice versa. Catches the asymmetry-drift failure
mode where a new feature ships docs in only one language and the
other language silently lags.

Sub-task 5 of MKDOCS-DISCIPLINE-01. The hand-maintained-twice
drift between mkdocs.yml and _meta.yaml (closed in commits 1-3
of that series) was one shape of docs drift; bilingual asymmetry
is another. Pre-inspection on 2026-05-07 found zero asymmetries
in the v0.30.0 state - the test passes out of the gate. Future
asymmetries that are intentional (e.g. landing pages) get added
to the EXCEPTIONS_ constants below with a comment.
