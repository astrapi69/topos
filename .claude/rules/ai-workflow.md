# AI Workflow

## Session start

On the first message of a session:
1. Read docs/ROADMAP.md (current state, open items).
2. Review recent changes: git log --oneline -10
3. Run make test (establish a green baseline).
   Only then start on the task.

## Interpreting "continue" / "next item"

When the user says "continue", "next item", "go on" or similar:
1. Read docs/ROADMAP.md, section "Next steps".
2. Name the first open item (unchecked checkbox).
3. Wait for confirmation, do NOT start implementing immediately.

## Order for new features

1. Check whether the feature belongs in a plugin or in the core.
2. Look at existing patterns (e.g. how plugin-export is structured).
3. Schema/model first (Pydantic schema or TypeScript interface).
4. Backend logic (service module, then route).
5. Frontend (extend API client, then UI).
6. Write unit and integration tests (pytest, Vitest).
7. Playwright smoke tests for UI features: for every new UI feature write at least one spec under `e2e/smoke/`. Must cover: happy path, relevant viewport sizes (600/800/1080 for layout-critical features), data-testid selectors (no brittle CSS selectors). Claude Code WRITES the specs, Aster RUNS them. No feature counts as done without a smoke test.
8. Add i18n strings in all 8 languages (DE, EN, ES, FR, EL, PT, TR, JA).
9. Conventional commit.

## Order for new plugins

1. Create the plugin folder: plugins/topos-plugin-{name}/
2. pyproject.toml with entry point: [project.entry-points."topos.plugins"]
3. Plugin class: {Name}Plugin(BasePlugin) with name, version, depends_on.
4. YAML config: backend/config/plugins/{name}.yaml
5. Hook implementations (if needed, new hook specs in hookspecs.py).
6. routes.py for API endpoints.
7. Frontend manifest via get_frontend_manifest() (UI slots).
8. Tests in plugins/{name}/tests/.
9. Enable the plugin in config/app.yaml under `enabled`.

## Order for changes

1. Read and understand the existing tests.
2. Implement the change.
3. Adjust or extend the tests.
4. Make sure `make test` stays green.

## Not allowed (AI-specific)

For code-level prohibitions (fetch, console.log, Tailwind, etc.) see coding-standards.md and architecture.md.

Additionally for the AI:
- Introduce new dependencies without asking first.
- Change architectural decisions (e.g. replace SQLAlchemy, replace TipTap).
- Change PluginForge code from inside Topos (separate repo!).
- Change the plugin structure (BasePlugin, hook specs) without asking.
- Generate code "for later". Only what is needed now.
- Delete, comment out or weaken existing tests to make `make test` green.
- Build custom TipTap extensions without first checking whether an official one exists.
- Throw HTTPException from service functions. Services use ToposError subclasses (see code-hygiene.md).
- In autonomous mode, guess when something is unclear. Prefer to stop and document the uncertainty.

## Current state

See architecture.md for architectural details. Additionally note:
- Version: 0.17.0 (one-click launcher install/uninstall across Windows/macOS/Linux, auto-update check with opt-out, cleanup retry, activity log, manuscripta 0.9.0 + Pillow 12).
- Tests: see `docs/audits/current-coverage.md` for current counts. `make test` covers backend+plugins+Vitest, E2E is separate.
- 26 ChapterTypes (3 marketing types in audiobook-export skip list by default).
- 15 official TipTap extensions + 1 community (@pentestpad/tiptap-extension-figure).
- 24 toolbar buttons in the editor.
- Deployment: Docker Compose, port 7880, install.sh one-liner.
- IMPORTANT: Before writing custom code, ALWAYS check whether a TipTap extension or library already exists.
- IMPORTANT: See lessons-learned.md for known pitfalls (TipTap, import, export).

## Test coverage audits

### When to run

- **After a major feature phase** (3+ new modules or endpoints): run a focused audit on the changed areas.
- **Before a release**: run a full pyramid audit covering all levels (unit, integration, E2E).
- **Quarterly**: run a full audit even without a release to catch organic drift.
- **On request**: when the user asks for a coverage check or gap analysis.

### Format

Audits follow the structure in `docs/audits/current-coverage.md`:

1. **Coverage map** - table per pyramid level (backend unit, plugin unit, integration, frontend unit, E2E). Each row: module/endpoint, test file, coverage rating (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/NONE).
2. **Prioritized gap list** - categorized as Critical (A/B), Standard (C), Nice-to-have (D). Critical = regression pinning or data integrity. Standard = normal coverage for untested modules. Nice-to-have = unlikely edge cases.
3. **Summary statistics** - tested/total counts per level, overall coverage percentage.

### File location conventions

```
docs/audits/
  current-coverage.md            # always the latest audit
  history/
    2026-04-12-coverage.md       # snapshot frozen at audit date
    2026-MM-DD-coverage.md       # subsequent snapshots
```

- `current-coverage.md` is overwritten on every audit.
- Before overwriting, copy the previous version to `history/YYYY-MM-DD-coverage.md`.
- History files are never modified after creation.

### Delta tracking

Every audit must include:
- **Baseline**: the test counts at the start of the audit period.
- **Current**: the test counts after all changes.
- **Delta**: explicit +N per suite (e.g., "Backend: 244 -> 308, +64").
- **Gaps closed**: list of items that moved from "untested" to "tested" since the last audit.

When closing gaps in a session, update `current-coverage.md` immediately - do not wait for the next full audit.

## Where coverage runs

Coverage runs on CI, not as part of the normal local workflow.
Running full coverage locally (`make test-coverage`) is heavy
and thermally stresses the developer machine, so it is opt-in
only.

- `make test` - default everyday command. Fast, no coverage.
  Stays green as the gate after every change.
- `make test-coverage` - explicit opt-in. Runs backend, frontend
  and the 5 in-CI plugins (export, grammar, kdp, kinderbuch,
  ms-tools) with `pytest --cov` and `vitest --coverage`. Frontend
  coverage requires Node 20+; lower versions fail with a
  `node:inspector/promises` ImportError. CI uses Node 24 so this
  is only a local concern.
- `.github/workflows/coverage.yml` - runs on every push to main
  and every PR. Uploads HTML reports + coverage.xml as
  GitHub Actions artifacts (14 day retention):
    - `backend-coverage`
    - `topos-plugin-{export,grammar,kdp,kinderbuch,ms-tools}-coverage`
    - `frontend-coverage`

To pull the latest coverage reports without running coverage
locally:

```bash
gh run download --name backend-coverage
gh run download --name frontend-coverage
gh run download --name topos-plugin-export-coverage  # etc.
```

`audiobook` and `translation` plugins are not yet in the coverage
matrix - they are tested by `make test` but not by CI's
`ci.yml` plugin matrix either, so adding them to coverage is
paired with adding them to ci.yml in a follow-up.

Codecov integration is intentionally not wired up. Adding it is
a separate prompt: enable the repo on codecov.io, add
`CODECOV_TOKEN` to GitHub Secrets, append a `codecov-action`
step after each coverage step in `coverage.yml`.

## Single source of truth for volatile statistics

Numbers that change with every feature or test session live in ONE canonical location. Other documentation references that location instead of duplicating the number.

| Statistic | Canonical location | Example reference |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Test counts, coverage percentages, pyramid stats | `docs/audits/current-coverage.md` | "See docs/audits/current-coverage.md for test statistics." |
| ChapterType list and count | `backend/app/models/__init__.py` (the `ChapterType` enum) | "See the ChapterType enum in models for the full list." |
| Supported i18n languages | `backend/config/i18n/` (the directory listing) | "See config/i18n/ for supported languages." |
| Plugin catalog | `CLAUDE.md` plugin table | Reference CLAUDE.md or `config/plugins/`. |

**Never duplicate** these numbers in CLAUDE.md, README.md, ROADMAP.md, CONCEPT.md, rule files, or release notes. Historical documents (CHANGELOG, chat journals) are exempt because they record what was true at a point in time.

**Rationale:** duplicated numbers drift out of sync within one session. A single source is always correct because there is only one place to update.

**When writing documentation:** if you need to mention a count, write the principle or the reference, not the number. Example: "Topos supports multiple languages (see config/i18n/)" instead of "Topos supports 8 languages".

## Numeric claims verification

Any numeric claim about the project must be verified by running
the authoritative command in the same session it is reported.

This rule applies to ALL of:

- Public documentation (README, CHANGELOG, blog posts, release
  notes, GitHub releases)
- Internal documentation (session journals, coverage audits,
  explorations, handover documents)
- Commit messages and pull-request descriptions
- Chat summaries and status reports
- Any claim made to the user about project size or status

Numbers covered by this rule include (non-exhaustive):

- Test counts (backend, plugin, frontend, smoke, aggregate)
- File counts, line counts, commit counts
- Plugin counts (number of plugins)
- Coverage percentages
- Release counts, version-in-use counts
- Any "N passed / N failed / N skipped" statistic

Verification means running the actual command, not:

- Grep output (grep can miss entries due to line-parsing or
  pagination)
- Memory of a previous count
- Inferring from another count
- Hardcoded numbers from an old session journal

If a command cannot be run in the current session (environment
issue, network issue), the number must be marked as "approximate"
or "as of [last verified date]" and flagged for verification in
the next session.

### Required verification commands for common numbers

- **Backend tests:** `cd backend && poetry run pytest --collect-only -q | tail -5`
- **Plugin tests total:** iterate all plugins:
  ```
  for dir in plugins/*/; do
    echo "=== $dir ==="
    cd "$dir" && poetry run pytest --collect-only -q 2>/dev/null | tail -3
    cd - >/dev/null
  done
  ```
- **Plugin count:** `ls -d plugins/*/ | wc -l`
- **Frontend Vitest:** `cd frontend && npx vitest --run --reporter=verbose 2>&1 | tail -5`
- **Playwright smoke:** `cd frontend && npx playwright test e2e/smoke/ 2>&1 | tail -5`
- **LOC (approximate):** `git ls-files | xargs wc -l | tail -1`

### Incident record

This rule exists because of two repeated incidents:

1. v0.19.1 article session (2026-04-20): plugin test count
   reported as 317, actual 409. Caught pre-publication.
2. v0.20.0 release journal (2026-04-20): plugin test count
   reported as 317 again, actual 409. Caught in internal docs.

Both were grep-parse errors where `export` plugin (92 tests) was
missed in the parse. Both would have been prevented by running
the full per-plugin iteration.

### When the user provides a number

If a user states a number in conversation (e.g. "we have 31
failing tests"), this number is a starting point, not authoritative.
Re-verify before echoing it back in any document or commit. Users
are frequently working from their own stale sources.

## Communication

- Direct, factual, no sugar-coating.
- If something is unclear: ask, do not guess.
- If something violates the architecture: say so, do not silently work around it.
- Suggestions are welcome, but mark them as suggestions.

## Self-clarification rule

When a question arises mid-task that cannot be answered from the
current context, do NOT guess. Three options, in order of
preference:

1. **Answer it from evidence in the repo.** Check git history,
   adjacent files, related rules in `.claude/rules/`, or existing
   patterns. If a defensible answer exists in the repo, use it
   and note the basis in the final report.

2. **Park the question with a clear marker.** If no evidence
   resolves it, write the section as best you can with the most
   conservative assumption, mark the spot in the file with an
   inline HTML comment
   `<!-- TODO(clarify): <specific question> -->`,
   and continue. Do not block the session waiting for an answer
   to a non-blocking question.

3. **Stop and ask** ONLY if the question blocks meaningful
   progress (e.g. cannot proceed without knowing whether to keep
   or remove a major section, cannot tell which of two
   contradictory sources is canonical, would otherwise risk a
   destructive change).

At the end of every session, the final report MUST include a
"Questions and assumptions" section listing:

- Each parked question with location and the conservative
  assumption that was taken
- Each evidence-based answer that was derived, with the source
- Any STOP-blocking questions that came up and how they were
  resolved

This applies to features, refactors, audits, and documentation
work alike. The goal is that no silent guess ever ships - either
the answer is grounded in repo evidence, or the open question is
visible in the artifact and the report.

## Documentation protocol

Every session is documented. This is mandatory, not optional. The documentation serves as a retrospective and as a knowledge base for future sessions.

### Chat journal (docs/journal/chat-journal-session-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md)

Session journals (chat-journal-session-YYYY-MM-DD.md) are committed to docs/journal/ as part of the end-of-session workflow. They are part of project history, not local notes.

Every relevant step of the work is recorded. Format per entry:

```markdown
## {No}. {Short title} ({HH:MM})

- Original prompt: what was said/asked
- Optimized prompt: how it could have been phrased more precisely
- Goal: what should be achieved
- Result: what was actually done
- Commit: {hash} (if code was changed)
```

At the end of every session: a summary with statistics (commits, tests, new/changed files, main results).

**What belongs in the journal:**
- Every implemented change (feature, fix, refactoring)
- Architectural decisions and their rationale
- Problems that came up and how they were solved
- Prompt optimizations (original vs. better wording)

**What does NOT belong in the journal:**
- Small talk, repetitions, typo fixes

### When to update CLAUDE.md

CLAUDE.md is loaded on EVERY prompt. It has to stay lean (target: under 8000 characters, ~2000 tokens). Only content that is ALWAYS relevant:

- Project description, repository, version, pointers to ROADMAP/CHANGELOG/API
- Pointer to .claude/rules/ with short descriptions
- Tech stack keywords (no package version numbers)
- Architecture summary in 2-3 sentences
- Makefile targets
- Session-start checklist
- Data model in short form
- Plugin table (name, tier, dependency, short description)
- Directory structure, top level only
- Core conventions (max 10 bullets)
- Overall test counts

Update when:
- A plugin is added, removed, or its tier changes
- A new dependency joins the tech stack
- Test counts have changed substantially
- New Makefile targets
- Data model changes (new fields, new ChapterTypes)
- Version bumped

NOT in CLAUDE.md:
- Full directory tree down to the file level (-> becomes redundant with file exploration)
- Complete package tables with version numbers (-> package.json/pyproject.toml)
- Every API endpoint individually (-> docs/API.md)
- Completed phase details (-> docs/CHANGELOG.md)
- Detailed deployment instructions (-> README.md)
- Migration status tables (-> historical, belongs in the CHANGELOG)

### When to update docs/CHANGELOG.md

- IMMEDIATELY when a phase is completed. Do not accumulate in CLAUDE.md.
- New entry at the TOP with phase number, version, description.
- Format: bullet-point list of the main changes, structured the same way as existing entries.
- After the entry: set the CLAUDE.md version to the new version, update test counts.

### When to update docs/API.md

- New endpoint added
- Endpoint removed or renamed
- Query parameters changed

### When to update docs/ROADMAP.md

- New open task
- Task completed (checkbox)
- Phase planned or prioritized

### ROADMAP priority tiers

`docs/ROADMAP.md` and `docs/backlog.md` are sorted by priority.
Section headers `## P0` through `## P5` mark the tiers, top to
bottom; a `## Blocked / Upstream Wait` section sits between P5
and the archive link.

| Tier | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **P0** | Deadline pressure, active blocker, security issue, or production-data risk. "Do this now." |
| **P1** | Architecture / hygiene debt. Code-rule violations, test isolation gaps, things that would block a clean release. |
| **P2** | High-value user features. Anything moving Topos from "toy to serious tool". |
| **P3** | Infrastructure / quality. Test coverage, CI / tooling, internal refactors with no user-visible effect. |
| **P4** | Roadmap / future phases. Items deliberately deferred to a later phase. |
| **P5** | Speculative / nice-to-have. No concrete trigger or user demand. |
| **Blocked / Upstream Wait** | Items waiting on an external trigger (npm publish, paid-API access, hardware availability, user report). NOT P0 even when critical. |

Within each tier, sub-order by:
1. Smaller scope first (faster wins).
2. Items unblocking other items first.
3. Alphabetical by ID as final tiebreaker.

Document the tier of each item by section header. Do NOT add
P-prefixes to the IDs themselves (T-01 stays T-01, not P2-T-01).
The tier is a section header, the ID is the task.

### Backlog-as-pointer convention

`docs/backlog.md` is a daily-planning view of `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
It is NOT a duplicate definition store.

- A task that lives in ROADMAP must NOT have its full body
  duplicated in backlog. Use a one-line pointer instead:
  `- **DEP-02**: TipTap 2 -> 3 (BLOCKED) — see ROADMAP > Blocked / Upstream Wait.`
- A task that lives only in backlog (no ROADMAP entry) keeps its
  full body. The backlog is the queue for not-yet-promoted ideas.
- When backlog and ROADMAP disagree, ROADMAP wins.

### Archive

Completed tasks are archived to `docs/roadmap-archive/`:

- `phase-1-complete.md` (v0.1.0..v0.14.0). One-time Phase 1 -> 2
  transition snapshot.
- `v0.25.0-cleanup-2026-05-02.md` (Phase 2 work shipped between
  v0.15.0 and v0.25.0). One-time bulk extract.
- `backlog-recently-closed-2026-05-02.md` (backlog "Recently
  closed" prose). One-time bulk extract.
- `YYYY-MM.md` (e.g. `2026-05.md`). Continuous-archival monthly
  bucket. One file per month, written by
  `scripts/archive_completed_task.py`. Each session's closures
  land here under a `## Archived YYYY-MM-DD` section, newest day
  first.

Active files (`ROADMAP.md` and `backlog.md`) contain ONLY open
`- [ ]` items. Do not re-add closed tasks to the active files;
if a closed task needs to come back, create a new ID. Stable IDs
across the archive boundary mean single-word prompts like
"implement T-01" still resolve.

### Continuous archival rule

When a task in `ROADMAP.md` or `backlog.md` is marked `[x]` AND
the work is genuinely done, archive it in the same commit that
closes it. Active files contain ONLY open work; completed tasks
live in `docs/roadmap-archive/YYYY-MM.md`.

#### Definition of done

A task is done when ALL of:

- Code is implemented and merged to `main`.
- Tests for the change are green (`make test`).
- Documentation is updated (CLAUDE.md, API docs, help articles).
- CHANGELOG entry exists if the change is user-facing.
- No follow-up work blocks closing the task (otherwise: split into
  sub-tasks).

#### Workflow

1. Complete the work.
2. Mark the task `[x]` in `ROADMAP.md` or `backlog.md`.
3. Run `make archive-task` (interactive) or
   `make archive-task-dry` to preview.
4. Confirm each `[x]` candidate with `y` / `n` / `s` (skip-all).
5. Confirmed items move to `docs/roadmap-archive/YYYY-MM.md`.
6. Commit ROADMAP, backlog, archive file together with the same
   change that closes the task:
   `feat(scope): implement T-01 (archived)`.

For scripted use (single ID, no prompt):
`python3 scripts/archive_completed_task.py --id T-01`.

A pre-commit hook (`roadmap-archive-reminder` in
`.pre-commit-config.yaml`) prints a non-blocking reminder when
staged changes introduce new `[x]` lines without an accompanying
archive update. The hook always exits 0; archival is the user's
responsibility, not a CI gate.

#### What NOT to do

- Do NOT batch up `[x]` items across releases. The 2026-05-02
  cleanup was a one-time recovery operation; the steady state is
  one task per archival.
- Do NOT archive items that are technically done but missing
  tests or docs. Finish them first.
- Do NOT delete tasks from active files without archiving. The
  archive is the audit trail.
- Do NOT manually edit archived task IDs. They are stable
  identifiers across history; future single-word prompts depend
  on them.
- Do NOT cross-month-consolidate the monthly buckets. An annual
  rollup is a separate decision; do not pre-empt it.

### When to update CONCEPT.md

- Architectural decision made or changed
- New plugin in the catalog (planned or implemented)
- Open question answered or new one raised
- Business model or licensing changed
- Tech stack change (new library, framework swap)
- UI strategy changed (new slots, new libraries)

### When to update lessons-learned.md

- New pitfall discovered (bug caused by a wrong pattern)
- Workaround found for a library limitation
- Import/export edge case solved
- CSS/TipTap specificity problem solved

### End-of-session flow

1. Write a chat-journal entry covering all changes from the session.
2. At phase completion: extend docs/CHANGELOG.md, bump the CLAUDE.md version.
3. Check whether CLAUDE.md, CONCEPT.md, ROADMAP.md, API.md or lessons-learned.md need updates.
4. Commit everything: `docs: update chat journal and documentation`
5. For larger milestones: add a summary with statistics to the journal.
6. For a release: follow release-workflow.md step by step. Do not improvise the release process.
