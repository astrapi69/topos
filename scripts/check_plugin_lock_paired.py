"""Pre-commit hook: a staged plugin pyproject.toml must be paired with its poetry.lock.

Sub-task 2 of PLUGIN-LOCKFILE-DRIFT-01. Catches the operational
mistake that produced the v0.30.0 release CI red-on-main: editing
``plugins/topos-plugin-<name>/pyproject.toml`` without running
``poetry lock`` in the same plugin directory before committing.

The shape — `make test` green but per-plugin CI red — is documented
in `.claude/rules/lessons-learned.md` "Two installation paths
diverge: `make test` vs per-plugin CI". The backend's combined
``poetry.lock`` can satisfy a path-dep install while each plugin's
own ``poetry.lock`` lags. CI runs `poetry install --no-interaction`
per plugin and aborts when the lockfile is stale.

Pre-commit framework invokes this hook with each staged
``plugins/topos-plugin-<name>/pyproject.toml`` path as a
positional argument (scoped via ``files:`` regex in
``.pre-commit-config.yaml``). For each such path, the hook checks
whether the corresponding ``poetry.lock`` in the same plugin
directory is also staged in the current commit (consulting
``git diff --cached --name-only``). If pyproject is staged without
its lock, the hook fails with a remediation hint pointing at
``make lock-plugin-<name>`` (deferred per Q1) or
``make lock-all-plugins``.

Per the pre-inspection Q2 conservative scope: the hook only checks
the pyproject-staging direction. Lockfile-only changes (e.g. as a
follow-up commit after `poetry lock`) are valid and do not trigger.

Exits:
  0 — every staged plugin pyproject is paired with its lockfile,
      OR no plugin pyproject is staged
  1 — at least one plugin pyproject is staged without its lock
  2 — git command failed (defensive; hook can't operate)
