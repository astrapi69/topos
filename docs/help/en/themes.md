# Themes

MyApp ships with six color palettes, each available in a light and a dark variant. Pick the palette under **Settings > Display**; toggle light and dark with the sun/moon icon in the sidebar.

## Available palettes

### Warm Literary *(default)*
Warm cream and brown tones with Crimson Pro as the serif typeface. MyApp's original palette, evoking classic print on paper.

### Cool Modern
Cool blue-grey tones with Inter as the sans-serif typeface. Clean, modern layout for authors who prefer a sober look.

### Nord
The popular Nord palette, adapted for MyApp. Muted pastel tones suited to long reading sessions.

### Classic *(new)*
Paper-like feel with warm beige and cream tones and a bordeaux accent. Serif typography (Crimson Pro) everywhere - editor, sidebar, UI. The editor additionally renders a first-line indent on every paragraph except the first one after a heading, following the typographic convention for literary prose.

**When to pick it:** literary writing, novels, fiction. For authors coming from paper-like tools.

### Studio *(new)*
Dark, professional look with high contrast and a mint/teal accent. Visually inspired by professional audio/video editing software. The light variant applies the same accent to a muted light-grey canvas. Inter for UI text, Source Serif Pro for headings.

**When to pick it:** long writing sessions with minimal visual distraction. Power users working for hours at a stretch.

### Notebook *(new)*
Light paper with a ruled-lines look, like a notebook page. The editor gets subtle horizontal lines (1.6em line-height) and a red margin line down the left side. Lora as the serif typeface. The dark variant keeps the same lines with adjusted colors.

**When to pick it:** handwritten writing feel, brainstorming, notebook-style workflows.

## Light/dark variant

Each of the six palettes exists in a light and a dark variant. Light/dark is independent of palette choice - clicking the sun/moon icon toggles light and dark while keeping the palette intact. The two dimensions combine into twelve total theme variants.

## Technical notes

- All themes use the same CSS variables. Plugins that contribute UI can support every theme without additional work by using `var(--bg-*)`, `var(--text-*)`, `var(--accent)`, `var(--border)`, `var(--shadow-*)` instead of hardcoded colors.
- All fonts are bundled locally (O-01 completed). No external font services are contacted.
- The theme selection is persisted in browser `localStorage` (`myapp-app-theme` for the palette, `myapp-theme` for light/dark). On first launch MyApp follows the system preference for light/dark and defaults the palette to Warm Literary.
